## 4. Optimization Recommendations

### 4.1 Fee Optimization

#### High-Demand Channels
- **Action**: Balance-based fee adjustment
  - Outbound: 60-70 ppm
  - Inbound: 130-150 ppm
- **Base Fee**: Maintain at 1000 msats
- **Targets**: Major exchange channels

#### Balanced Channels
- **Action**: Balanced fee structure
  - Outbound: 40-50 ppm
  - Inbound: 90-110 ppm
- **Base Fee**: 1000 msats
- **Targets**: Well-established merchant channels

#### Underutilized Channels
- **Action**: Progressive fee reduction
  - Outbound: 20-30 ppm
  - Inbound: 70-90 ppm
- **Base Fee**: 600 msats
- **Targets**: New merchant connections

### 4.2 Geographic Routing Optimization

- **Region-based Fee Structure**:
  - Intercontinental routes: 55-65 ppm outbound / 140-160 ppm inbound
  - Intra-European routes: 35-45 ppm outbound / 90-110 ppm inbound
  - Local routes: 20-30 ppm outbound / 80-100 ppm inbound

### 4.3 Dynamic Fee Policy

- **Implementation**: Complete Lightning Terminal integration
- **New Rules**:
  - Channel utilization (>80% → increase fees)
  - Channel balance (imbalance >60/40 → asymmetric fee adjustment)
  - Time-based adjustments (peak hours: 09:00-13:00 UTC and 17:00-21:00 UTC)
  - Transaction size incentives (reduced fees for >1.5M sat transactions)
