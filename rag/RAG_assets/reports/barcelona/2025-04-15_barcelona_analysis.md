## 4. Optimization Recommendations

### 4.1 Fee Optimization

#### High-demand Channels
- **Action**: Increase fees from 28 ppm to 45-55 ppm
- **Base fee**: Maintain at 1000 msats
- **Targets**: Channels to 0217890e3aad8d35bc054f43bdb64c1185b5cd857e65f3c116e52fdc87e8f93e55, 03d5e17a3c213fe490e1b0c389f8cfcfcea08a29717d50a9f453735e0ab2a7c003, and 033d8656219478701227199cbd6f670335c8d408a92ae88b962c49d4dc0e83e025

#### Underutilized Channels
- **Action**: Reduce fees from 28 ppm to 12-18 ppm
- **Base fee**: Reduce from 1000 msats to 300 msats
- **Targets**: Channels to 03baa70886d9200af0ffbd3f9e18d96008d8ddb9dbb9cfefb17f7b8f23111fbe95 and 02ce1d45b152c292bbef83a375cec0e0b15c91742642a99e1c4b39f4dc302fce0f

### 4.2 Geographic Routing Optimization

- **Implement region-based fee structure**:
  - Cross-continental routes: 40-45 ppm
  - Intra-European routes: 20-25 ppm
  - Local regional routes: 15-20 ppm

### 4.3 Advanced Dynamic Fee Policy

- **Recommendation**: Implement advanced policy using Lightning Terminal or Charge-LND
- **Configuration rules**:
  - Channel utilization (>75% → increase fees)
  - Channel balance (imbalance >65/35 → adjust fees asymmetrically)
  - Time of day (higher fees during peak hours: 10:00-14:00 UTC and 18:00-22:00 UTC)
  - Transaction size (lower fees for large transactions: >1M sats)
